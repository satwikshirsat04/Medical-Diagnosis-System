# Medical Diagnosis System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Medical Diagnosis System** is an AI-powered application designed to assist in diagnosing diseases based on user symptoms. The system leverages machine learning techniques to predict possible health conditions and provide relevant medical insights.

## 🚀 Features Implemented
- **User Input Interface**: Allows users to enter symptoms.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained on medical datasets for disease prediction.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Cleans and processes input data efficiently.
- **Diagnosis Prediction**: Provides possible disease outcomes based on symptoms.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Interactive and simple interface using Streamlit.
- **Medical Recommendations**: Offers general advice and next steps.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
```yaml
Frontend: Streamlit (Python-based UI framework)
Backend: Python (Streamlit for UI and API handling)
Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
Database: SQLite/MySQL (if storing user history)
Deployment: Vercel / Heroku / AWS (if applicable)
```

## 📖 How to Set Up & Run

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
[git clone https://github.com/your-username/Medical-Diagnosis-System.git](https://github.com/satwikshirsat04/Medical-Diagnosis-System.git)
cd Medical-Diagnosis-System
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 4️⃣ Access the Web Interface
After running the command, Streamlit will automatically open a web page, or you can manually open:
```bash
http://localhost:8501/
```

## 🎯 Usage Guide
```yaml
1. Enter your symptoms in the provided input fields.
2. Click on Predict to get possible diagnoses.
3. Review the output along with medical recommendations.
4. Seek professional medical advice based on the predictions.
```
